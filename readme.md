# Dropping a grapefruit
Suppose Hector drops a grapefruit off a high bridge and lets it fall until it hits the water. If we neglect air resistance, then the distance *d* in meters fallen by the grapefruit after *t* seconds is d = 0.5 x g x t^2 , where the acceleration of gravity is the constant g = 9.8 (m/s^2). 

Write a program that asks the user to input the number of seconds that a grapefruit falls from a bridge above the water. The program should then calculate the distance fallen for each second from t = 0 until the value of t input by the user and display the output on the console.

Please input the time of fall in seconds:
